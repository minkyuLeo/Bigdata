The rightful winner is Liverpool who is suppose to be 9 points ahead.",

I hated the way the pen was given by him leaving his leg in, that was soft and if that was the other way around I doubt that would have been given and I hated considering what happened with the pen, that our goal should be disallowed with even less contact, it makes zero sense. \n\nI also don't doubt Christie likely should have seen red. \n\nMy problem is the tribalism by football fans clouds their ability to say \"Yeah your team did/didn't deserve that\", they just want it all their own way, there is no compromise on the incidents.

You cannot compare statistics if Neto has played all season and Travers only a few times.\nTravers doesn't make mistakes and Neto makes too many. This alone put Travers ahead and makes a mockery of \"clean sheet\" \nClean sheets is largely down to the defence not the goalkeeper and also depends upon the teams you ar playing. You must be repeating the pundits and commentators who say nonsense things based on statistics not reality.\n\nNeto has cost the team goals and points unnecessarily by poor and slack play and he continually takes risks.\nI've seen Travers play many games, there is no doubt he is better. He was better when Neto came.\nManagers are often persuaded by the wrong factors and do not make objective decisions based on actual performance.\n\nSame with Unal, he doesn't play him enough or give him enough game time. He doesn't need to replace any but should have much more game time.",

As per the refs, the English FA and its other associations are just corrupt and incompetent, some of these calls are scripted to keep the Premier league's moniker of being the most exciting league in the world. That said, Arsenal should know that they too have been at the end of some favourable refereeing dubious calls, Havertz should have gone off against Newcastle, that United game where Saka should have had a card, a Pen against Gabriel and Garnacho legitimate goal ruled out.

Everton have played top flight football for about 100 years longer than Bournemouth have and have won 15 major trophies including 9 lg titles 5 FA cups and a European trophy and we lost got relegated in 1951 -54 only Arsenal have more consecutive top flight seasons than Everton, just cause we've had our worst 2 seasons in 20 odd years thanks to Benitez and Lampard with there 30% win record and just weren't up to the job. That doesn't mean teams who spent more time in lower leagues  should expect to beat us. Apart from one or 2 seasons recently the norm is for Bournemouth to either be fighting relegation or going down that is not normal for Everton apart from the previous 2 seasons. I hope yous do stay up and may do because Sheff utd, Luton, Burnley and Wolves are probably worse.",

In return for what? 5 points from 5 matches with only a single win against Luton Town. This is intolerable in the premier League and heads must roll from now before another season is lost.\nLet's start with the coach. Pochettino is a joyrider on holiday in London. He has no track record to boast of. At PSG,he dismally failed despite having a galaxy of stars like Neymar Jr,Mbappe,Messi and a host of others. He should be sacked immediately. \nSadly,I cannot rule out conspiracy among the scouts. All the Chelsea signings are highly praised and priced before arrival..but the script changes the moment they land at Stamford bridge. There is no decent incisive goal scorer in the whole of the Chelsea squad.\nTactically,there is no team work, neither is there individual brilliance.",

In fact, not only do referees generally have a problem with going down soft, top level referees have been known to actually tell players they need to go down to get the whistle. \n\nThe real question you should ask yourself is whether you prefer players who decided to go down soft before contact, or players who decide after.  IMNSHO, the real cheaters are the ones who are swerving into defenders and are just dropping to the ground at the slightest touch.  Szobo here feels significant contact and then decides to go down.

So sick of the fabricated despair, when any team or manager will face issues with part of the team not working. This season was until 2024 a huge improvement on last year. But defence has let us down in 2024. \n\nThere were problems in attack and the club's resources went to fixing that and arguably Moyes achieved it, with a very exciting attacking lineup. Meanwhile, the defensive reinforcements haven't worked out and now that Zouma and Ogbonna are over the hill and should not be starting games, there just isn't anyone good enough to replace them. Both Aguerd and Mavraponos can be accident prone. And defence has been a problem now for two seasons. \r\n\r\nMoyes would fix it. He knows how and he most certainly would in the summer if given time and a budget. \r\n\r\nBut of course some fans don't want to give him to fix that problem. They are happy that it exists so they can hound him out. They couldn't wait and even when it was just one or two bad games they already started with their abuse and hounding, generating so much negativity that it has slowly seeped into the majority like a poison. \n\nDisgusts me that those people call themselves fans or even that they pretend to know about football.

Soucek was consistently caught out of position because he was being tasked with covering the entirety of midfield when Bowen wouldn't track back fast enough and Alvarez was stuck on the right side.\nThe entirety of the defense felt like they were in two minds about stretching to cover wide runs by Cucurella and Madueke or squeeze in to force them to cross, so they kind of did neither very well and allowed passes to slip in the half spaces between players\nIt really just felt like, tactically speaking, the team was set up to lose. There was no mind given to how Chelsea had set up against Spurs, so Cucurella was allowed to perform exactly the same free role he did in that game, completely overloading the midfield in possession.\n\nI really don't think the players were to blame in a vacuum, the tactics just felt like they weren't thought through at all.",

Please leave a lot of likes and comments. Please copy and post comments.) - I collected only the deleted comments from the Hive Channel's music video. 1. Bang Si-hyuk asked Min Hee-jin to release a praise song for Dan World. Min Hee-jin wrote the lyrics of \"Dan World\" as Bang Si-hyuk wanted, and in the music video, he said \"Dan World Praiser\" = A psychopath\" in the back of his head --> OMG's music video timeline (\"Dan World = Dangun Shinhwa\")OMG M/V video timeline 0:57 I exist for you. =Pronunciation 1:28 so that it sounds like 'Dangshin' by intentionally ordering foreign member Hani, so are you Siri? = So are you God? \n2:32 There are two Minji. Laughing at the meaning of \"God is only\" \n2:39 The Revenant in the table of contents of the story = The story of fighting against the bear \n2:49 The subway that Hye-in is riding is on the screen so that only the 'God' is cut off on purpose to Sindorim!! (Suddenly, 'Suddenly' changed to 'Sudorim' at 2024.04.29.) \n2:54 Hye-in rejected Daniel and ran away\n3:05 Hye-in lies down after eating an apple \n3:11 Daniel (= The name itself means God's judge angel) Go to Hye-in's rescue \n3:16 Daniel and Hye-in are both attacked by a bear With the lyrics saying \n3:22 Dan 'You're the only one.' Attention the bear \n4:22 People are not sitting in the middle and a bear is placed in the middle of the table. \n4:40 Daniel's kids, this is a music video shoot! It's a reminder of reality. Officials remain silent. \n5:45 Picture of offering an apple to a bear 2. Girlfriend MAGO (God's name: Margot) = A witch-type festival = A sacrifice for his girlfriend Speculation that his girlfriend broke him up because she was all Christian3. Dan-world hand gesture = Magnetic (eyelet hand gesture) -> ADOR (under Hive) CEO Min Hee-jin resists pseudo -->! New Jeans success! --> But since they don't believe in pseudo-new Jeans, I should make it similar to the New Jeans concept. = Eyelet 4. The hanbok worn during New Year's greeting = Dan-world sign mark 5. BTS: Debut showcase at Dan-world Foundation Ilgi Art Hall, everyone except members graduated from Dan-world Cyber University, used Dan-world cosmetics. 6. Tubatu One day \"Horn\" grew from my head (debut song title) = The lyrics are similar to the Dan-world letter. 7. Bang Si-hyuk's opposition to joining Daniel New Jeans The reason why he rejects the name means that it is a Christian judgment8. ETA Lyrics The day you were the only one who couldn't come to my birthday party --> The day when Bang Si-hyuk and Hye-jin, who didn't come to the New Jeans debut celebration party, were scolded a lot --> The day Min Hee-jin and Ji-won broke up with her girlfriend due to OMG music video -> Park Ji-won (Vice President of 'Dan World' Hive), who disbanded his girlfriend (group), always broke up without you --> The day when he wore a really cool outfit called Le Seraphim and was distracted by the new clothes called Le Seraphim",

I think with a good summer we could be a serious European outfit next season -  Top 6 in the league minimum. Come on Tim, you know who performed and who needs to go. Sure up that defense (left-footed partner for Mav) another CM (Ndidi, Fofana, Andy Diouf) couple of young attacking weapons, Samu and Wesley and we can push for CL next season. When we don't 'play the badge' (like Moyes did first game against them this season) we match them. Really have a lot of faith in this group. Just important they know they play for a massive side. Attack the league next season. Moyes got it right today, tbf also . From the 11 to the subs in my opinion. Antonio club captain next season. Bowen captain. Only sell Paqueta if City have the full amount. if not, we add attacking power and sure up that defense.",

They knew that the result was secondary as long as they managed to go through to the seminfinals. So they first calmed their match down.

Leverkusen are just that good, even if they played shit for one half, plus they won the first fixture against West Ham 2-0 deservedly, so they could afford this due to that effort.

He's got to the point where he is getting basic fundamentals wrong. If you are playing two strikers, play forward quickly. Have the wide men on the side of their strong foot. Make sure the two CMs can cover the ground in the middle of the park. Danny Ings is a striker, an absolutely terrible one, but a striker. Did he drop off into midfield at any one stage past either Alvarez or JWP to collect the ball as you would expect a 10 to? no. The whole system was trash.

Its stupid to compare them with Zola, Grant and Bilic. cause they we are all here for only 2 years which is not enough to build your squad. \n\nMoyes can only be compared to Big Sam,  and i enjoy way more Big Sam team and had more hope in games than with Deluded Dave. If Conference League was never invented the man would be long gone.  The bloke won first trophy with us , not with Everton not with United, but with us. The bloke should be more thankful to us than we are to him.",

I really hope with all my heart as a Madridista and BVB fan that Xabi wins the triplet, league is already won, the German cup final vs Kaiserslautern too, and if they don't get Liverpool (coming back from 0-3 is difficult but certainly more than possible) in the EL finals I'd say they got the win in the bag, Milan or Roma in semis can't stop them.",

I feel that there is a huge requirement for the 10 in that system to support Antonio's press, and we may upset the opposition's build-up more with Kudus taking that role rather than Paqueta. You also gain the link-up between Emerson and Paqueta down the left-hand side that we have seen so frequently this season. This is a consideration rather than an out-and-out suggestion.\n\n3) I agreed with the decision to make a defensive sub at the 65-minute mark, but my sub at the time would have been Phillips for Antonio, go 4-5-1, push Paqueta to the left, and rather than leave Bowen up top, I would have opted for Kudus to be the makeshift CF. \n\nAll in all, it's a relatively new system and there may be tweaks that incrementally improve us. I would have liked this 11 to start the season as soon as Kudus arrived.\n\nIt's been excellent so far. We look like we are overwhelming teams at times which is great to see. I still think there is a place for that 'low-block' system that Moyes has employed so frequently this season, but I would like it to be used in 20% of the games, rather than 80%. \n\nJust my takes from the game.\n\nWe are looking like a really, really good side again. If we can continue in the same vein and overwhelm certain teams and revert back to the system we used more frequently at the beginning of the season against certain sides, I think it gives us two ways of getting results.  \n\nCOYI",

Last week, a Burnley player literally headed the ball into his own hands and did a volleyball serve, and that isn't handball. But Kurt Zoumas was a handball having his arms down his sides? If Kurt played with no arms, it would have been the exact same result. A goal. \n\nThe rule is bullshit. Westham got scammed over and over the last 2 years, and if you don't recognise it, that's fine, but I do.\n\nThe Newcastle goal where it was a clear freekick for Paqueta. They gave it the other way, and they scored directly from it.  VAR didn't go back and say that freekick was for Westham and not for Newcastle. But it will go back and look at 6 different phases of play to try and find a reason to disallow every goal we score.",

Liverpool or Man City should take the title as they have the means.\nEveryone expects Arsenal to flop.... prove us wrong. I do admire the young team... but perhaps something in the way of experience might be your downfall. No complaints from us yesterday. You can see our problems. But it's not about us is it?

I think he's a very talented player but I wonder if he's been put in some kind of straight-jacket at West Ham. And why haven't the betting allegations against him been sorted out?

Still can't believe he's still here after our summer spending.\nWe really do need to upgrade to a skillfull and creative winger who can genuinely scare and intimidate opposing defences.\nBenny does neither of these things.\nI could go on and on,i'v watched him like a hawk for the last two seasons and imo he's fallen out the lucky tree and hit every branch on the way down.\nPL baller?Not at all..and on what?60k,70k,80k a week?Mental isn't it?!\nHe's had his chances and now thank the Lord,Moyes has finally dropped him from the first 11.\nBut when he comes on you'd think he would learn from his previous perpetual mistakes but it's the same old Benny.\nYou can tell when a player doesn't know what he's going to do with the ball BEFORE he receives it because when they do they're indecisive in their play from the moment the ball is back at their feet,on many occasions the impetus and momentum is lost in a heartbeat, we find ourselves unnecessarily trying to start another phase and the crowd express their frustration... that's Benny all over... I'm sorry but that's just how he is.\nWe really must upgrade to a world class winger or at least a winger who has a proactive contribution to the play that's evolving around him.\nThanks for everything Benny but you're not at the level we're looking for.\nYou've done well for yourself n your family, earned a medal but time to go either in Jan or next summer.\nCOYI ",

We were not born in the same country and you're ignorance shows by looking at my name and assuming so. I've rooted for West Ham for almost 2 decades now so I'm always happy when the team wins. When did I ever state otherwise?  He plays the same way for his national team and the finesse type players from HIS country got the credit/attention when they did well for a long time. My family and I have plenty of things to be proud of in our lives as we live very comfortable while you come across as a bitter person typing in your mothers basement..

There is nothing negative about that. It takes huge resilience, concentration and skill, especially in the transition... \n\nYou can only use what you have. There are teams like Brighton that are set up to hold possession and move the ball, but usually those teams struggle against the really good teams that are as good defensively as they are in attack. Many of the top teams combine both counter-attacking and possession football, because they have the type of top players who can do both. \n\nToo often, our players lose the ball in positions where top teams hold onto to it and can build a possession based attack. Usually, we are better at this as the season progresses, and I think as Paqueta, Alvarez, WP and Kudus become familiar with each other, we will have better play through the middle. \n\nThe problem I see for us over and over is the inability to deal with the high press... so we end up having to do defend rather than break out or even just thread the ball. The high press creates an overlap, so it's three against two, and in that situation, we have come unstuck so many times. It's like we don't see the press working, or we give the ball to a player who doesn't have space, hasn't created space, or cannot handle the close pressure. At least with Rice, we had some composure in those areas. It's no surprise to me that since Rice left, our possession ratio has gone down. We need Paqueta to be able to use his skills and positioning to be the pivot so that we can handle that high press better. \n\nIt isn't just about the manager saying 'I want us to play defensively'. No manager ever says that. But a manager will say 'if we cannot win the game, let's not lose it', and that is something that West Ham have done so much in my 40+ years of following them. Moyes is the first manager I've seen who actually knows how to properly organise a defence, with the possible exception of Rednapp.",

He must have been exhausted and wanted to avoid Moyes' teachings.\r\n\r\nWe need to stop blaming the players. \r\n\r\nBecause if Moyes leaves, there will naturally be no places for Soucek and Antonio.\r\n\r\nEven if you have a player with Premier League experience, it is meaningless if Moyes remains.\r\n\r\nNoble and Steidten and a new manager must rebuild the team.\r\n\r\nEven if it fails, we must give meaning to the challenge with a new vision and plan.\r\n\r\nLast year we placed 14th. Even with experienced managers and players.\r\n\r\nNew challenges coexist with success and failure. However, Moyes' challenge only exists to fail.\r\n\r\nMoyes is a historical figure and a legend. that won't change.\r\n\r\nwe have to take on a new challenge of winning the Europa League.\r\n\r\nI say it again. Moyes' time ends here. \r\n\r\n\r\nAfter losing today, I had a good dream for a while, but west ham owner is Sullivan.",
