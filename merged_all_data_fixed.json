I hated the way the pen was given by him leaving his leg in, that was soft and if that was the other way around I doubt that would have been given and I hated considering what happened with the pen, that our goal should be disallowed with even less contact, it makes zero sense. \n\nI also don't doubt Christie likely should have seen red. \n\nMy problem is the tribalism by football fans clouds their ability to say \"Yeah your team did/didn't deserve that\", they just want it all their own way, there is no compromise on the incidents.

            "Bournemouth were the better team and for that deserved to win but the better team doesn’t always win.\r\n\r\nThe disallowed first Wolves goal was an atrocious VAR decision, obviously wrong. VAR has been against Bournemouth for a long time but even more so against Wolves.The corruption of the officials is breathtaking. They were hard put in this game wanting to rule against both teams.\r\n\r\nThe second Wolves goal was technically offside according to a strict application of the current rules but the rules need changing to daylight between the offender and defender. It doesn’t make sense for a player to be offside when in line. It is impossible for a player to make sure he is not offside and law should be certain. Of course the officials like it like this so that they can manipulate decisions.\r\n\r\nThe red card was dubious, the player got to the ball first and there was a collision, both players seeking to avoid hard contact.\r\n\r\nThe manipulation of results and team positions by the officials is both flagrant and ruining the game. Team positions become meaningless. They should be sued for their many inconsistent decisions, decisions against the rules and failure to follow their own procedures. It only requires proof on the balance of probabilities which is easy to show. When they are punished for their corruption and have to pay they will be forced to stop.\r\n\r\nEven when they admit to mistakes they do nothing to remedy or put right which simply shows it is deliberate and they do it with impunity. They would have you believe their flagrantly wrong decisions are merely stupidity  to cover their corruption.\r\n\r\nIt can be seen they make decisions to favour Arab money and very likely the government have secretly advised them to protect the clubs funded by Arab money because they fear the reprisals. We all know the Arabs are not models of integrity and have far too much influence in the UK and any connection with Russia brings sanctions. Man City and Everton are prime examples.\r\n\r\nFootball is becoming as corrupt as Parliament.",

You cannot compare statistics if Neto has played all season and Travers only a few times.\nTravers doesn't make mistakes and Neto makes too many. This alone put Travers ahead and makes a mockery of \"clean sheet\" \nClean sheets is largely down to the defence not the goalkeeper and also depends upon the teams you ar playing. You must be repeating the pundits and commentators who say nonsense things based on statistics not reality.\n\nNeto has cost the team goals and points unnecessarily by poor and slack play and he continually takes risks.\nI've seen Travers play many games, there is no doubt he is better. He was better when Neto came.\nManagers are often persuaded by the wrong factors and do not make objective decisions based on actual performance.\n\nSame with Unal, he doesn't play him enough or give him enough game time. He doesn't need to replace any but should have much more game time.",

The psychological effect of winning may help the lads’ mentality a huge deal. \n     My having supported the club since 1973 cannot deny the gratification of ‘Boscombe ‘ giving us top flight football - something I & most never believed we’d see - which makes the current situation worse knowing this position could be lost by those whom weren’t part of the overall or original achievement & a potential loss of footballing status comparable to neighbours Portsmouth or Yeovil Town wouldn’t be suffered by current playing & management personnel but by those faithful within the club machinery ,the replacement players ,those in the stands , the wider community & beyond. \n  Not all the clubs in this league are superclubs & the majority of the players faced by these Cherries aren’t immortals - they’re the same as them , very very good footballers - playing at the summit of English League football & these first pick Cherries all have the potential to be superheroes instead of well paid disappointments every time they pull on the AFC Bournemouth shirt😁👍",

Dyche rightly dropped him today but had to make a late change cause of Gueye get to g late injury. He needs to do it every week not when he feels like now he has competition he's hopefully realised. Needs to find the net too every week he has 2 or 3 chances and never scores.",

Pogba and Kante were predominantly DM and Casemero but they still go forward beating men and scoring goals this kid is 21 has no idea were his best position is yet. He's played further forward for Belgium and looked great. Garner plays RB RW and CM which any too pro should be able to do.",

We've lost all 3  home games by a single goal to Luton, Fulham and Wolves and despite having over 20 shots on target over 60 overall but couldn't score so again today we had 25 shots with 8 on target so it was only a matter of time we'd start winning and scoring more freely now we've got all our players back with Harrison starting his first game and DCL finally stringing 3 games together.

We had 15 shots on target in our 2 1-0 home losses to Wolves and Fulham. Since DCL has been back we've won 3-1 at Brentford, 3-0 at Villa in the cup and 3-0 today wining 3 from last 4 in all comps. Luton were no better than Bournemouth today but they scored 2 set pieces that We defended atrocious so we didn't deserve to win missing all them chances today we made our chances count now were close to full strength. Any team who plays there first 4 games of season without a striker fit all 4 wingers out and 3 FBs out is gonna struggle now DCL is back, McNeil, Harrison , Mykelenko and Patterson back Gray and Iwobi were out and got sold we had half a team now we have a proper team again. Last yr we d lost Richarlison sold Gordon and DCL was out 25 games. Well be fine this yr when your skint like us depending on loans and free transfers 4 in 1st team you can't replace 4 or 5 injured players with 60m players like some teams , our backups are u21s with no experience but were getting there now with good loan players like Danjuma and Harrison and a backup CF Beto.",

That doesn't mean teams who spent more time in lower leagues  should expect to beat us. Apart from one or 2 seasons recently the norm is for Bournemouth to either be fighting relegation or going down that is not normal for Everton apart from the previous 2 seasons. I hope yous do stay up and may do because Sheff utd, Luton, Burnley and Wolves are probably worse.",

He has no track record to boast of. At PSG,he dismally failed despite having a galaxy of stars like Neymar Jr,Mbappe,Messi and a host of others. He should be sacked immediately. \nSadly,I cannot rule out conspiracy among the scouts.

In fact, not only do referees generally have a problem with going down soft, top level referees have been known to actually tell players they need to go down to get the whistle. \n\nThe real question you should ask yourself is whether you prefer players who decided to go down soft before contact, or players who decide after.

A good win today with Muniz, whom I never rated until recently, starting to show some confidence and ability in front of goal. At least, we won't be fighting a relegation battle this season.",

The players switch around positions during play catching opponents unaware. A right winger can be on left vice versa certain scenarios an AM switching with the wingers. Wingers dropping into midfield. The defense too is fluid usually initiating some good attacking opportunities as well. He was smart to go for wingers with AM insights. Iwobi can play both, William is good when he gets into the midfield. Wilson, Parriera, Reed switching around as well. I love their style of play",

So mentioning him at all... it kinda reinforces our arguements because there surely would be that commonsense that because Kelleher was not that good, nor that he was confident so you can just take the easier chances, i.e, the ones in the box, and score. Fulham is not doing well, so they kinda had to.",

Es normal que en un delantero se le pidan o exigan goles, pero no siempre se puede anotar, a veces es eso, jugar ayudar al equipo, dar asistencias. Y si anota es buen delantero, sería mejor dicho goleador o caza goles. Si bien se ganan partidos con goles. El va llegando al equipo se debe de adaptar y asistirlo con buenos pases para que pueda anotar y también buscar el balónby anotar. Vamos RJ9 (RJ7) demuestra que si se puede. ⚽️🥅🇲🇽 Es un milagro que siga jugando. 🙏🏼 ✨️ En la Selección en dos partidos hizo tres goles, tiene efectividad.

So sick of the fabricated despair, when any team or manager will face issues with part of the team not working. This season was until 2024 a huge improvement on last year. But defence has let us down in 2024. \n\nThere were problems in attack and the club's resources went to fixing that and arguably Moyes achieved it, with a very exciting attacking lineup. Meanwhile, the defensive reinforcements haven't worked out and now that Zouma and Ogbonna are over the hill and should not be starting games, there just isn't anyone good enough to replace them. Both Aguerd and Mavraponos can be accident prone. And defence has been a problem now for two seasons. \r\n\r\nMoyes would fix it. He knows how and he most certainly would in the summer if given time and a budget. \r\n\r\nBut of course some fans don't want to give him to fix that problem. They are happy that it exists so they can hound him out. They couldn't wait and even when it was just one or two bad games they already started with their abuse and hounding, generating so much negativity that it has slowly seeped into the majority like a poison. \n\nDisgusts me that those people call themselves fans or even that they pretend to know about football.

Soucek was consistently caught out of position because he was being tasked with covering the entirety of midfield when Bowen wouldn't track back fast enough and Alvarez was stuck on the right side.\nThe entirety of the defense felt like they were in two minds about stretching to cover wide runs by Cucurella and Madueke or squeeze in to force them to cross, so they kind of did neither very well and allowed passes to slip in the half spaces between players\nIt really just felt like, tactically speaking, the team was set up to lose. There was no mind given to how Chelsea had set up against Spurs, so Cucurella was allowed to perform exactly the same free role he did in that game, completely overloading the midfield in possession.\n\nI really don't think the players were to blame in a vacuum, the tactics just felt like they weren't thought through at all.",

Please leave a lot of likes and comments. Please copy and post comments.) - I collected only the deleted comments from the Hive Channel's music video. 1. Bang Si-hyuk asked Min Hee-jin to release a praise song for Dan World. Min Hee-jin wrote the lyrics of \"Dan World\" as Bang Si-hyuk wanted, and in the music video, he said \"Dan World Praiser\" = A psychopath\" in the back of his head --> OMG's music video timeline (\"Dan World = Dangun Shinhwa\")OMG M/V video timeline 0:57 I exist for you. =Pronunciation 1:28 so that it sounds like 'Dangshin' by intentionally ordering foreign member Hani, so are you Siri? = So are you God? \n2:32 There are two Minji. Laughing at the meaning of \"God is only\" \n2:39 The Revenant in the table of contents of the story = The story of fighting against the bear \n2:49 The subway that Hye-in is riding is on the screen so that only the 'God' is cut off on purpose to Sindorim!! (Suddenly, 'Suddenly' changed to 'Sudorim' at 2024.04.29.) \n2:54 Hye-in rejected Daniel and ran away\n3:05 Hye-in lies down after eating an apple \n3:11 Daniel (= The name itself means God's judge angel) Go to Hye-in's rescue \n3:16 Daniel and Hye-in are both attacked by a bear With the lyrics saying \n3:22 Dan 'You're the only one.' Attention the bear \n4:22 People are not sitting in the middle and a bear is placed in the middle of the table. \n4:40 Daniel's kids, this is a music video shoot! It's a reminder of reality. Officials remain silent. \n5:45 Picture of offering an apple to a bear 2. Girlfriend MAGO (God's name: Margot) = A witch-type festival = A sacrifice for his girlfriend Speculation that his girlfriend broke him up because she was all Christian3. Dan-world hand gesture = Magnetic (eyelet hand gesture) -> ADOR (under Hive) CEO Min Hee-jin resists pseudo -->! New Jeans success! --> But since they don't believe in pseudo-new Jeans, I should make it similar to the New Jeans concept. = Eyelet 4. The hanbok worn during New Year's greeting = Dan-world sign mark 5. BTS: Debut showcase at Dan-world Foundation Ilgi Art Hall, everyone except members graduated from Dan-world Cyber University, used Dan-world cosmetics. 6. Tubatu One day \"Horn\" grew from my head (debut song title) = The lyrics are similar to the Dan-world letter. 7. Bang Si-hyuk's opposition to joining Daniel New Jeans The reason why he rejects the name means that it is a Christian judgment8. ETA Lyrics The day you were the only one who couldn't come to my birthday party --> The day when Bang Si-hyuk and Hye-jin, who didn't come to the New Jeans debut celebration party, were scolded a lot --> The day Min Hee-jin and Ji-won broke up with her girlfriend due to OMG music video -> Park Ji-won (Vice President of 'Dan World' Hive), who disbanded his girlfriend (group), always broke up without you --> The day when he wore a really cool outfit called Le Seraphim and was distracted by the new clothes called Le Seraphim",

            " @chanhnam4656  For as terrible as they were in the first half, completely outplayed and outrun by West Ham, they showed a very intelligent mature performance in the second half. Not only because they managed to regain control, which wasn't easy, but because they didn't needlessly chase a goal to preserve the unbeaten run and maybe make themselves vulnerable to counter attacks. They knew that the result was secondary as long as they managed to go through to the seminfinals. So they first calmed their match down. My guess is they would have been content with a 0-1, but of course Frimpong's equalizer was a nice one for the road.",
            " @TerryCadwell  You're clearly just some 'football fan' who only watches the premier league and nothing else, and thinks all other leagues are shit. Well, Leverkusen has beaten and drew with the very same Bayern that outed Arsenal in CL, they drew with Dortmund who finished on top of the group of death and outed Atletico Madrid in the quarter finals, they beat Leipzig back-to-back who should've likely outed Real in the CL had it no been for the poor officiating against them (like Vini no red card on the reverse fixture), and have also just not lost a single game, while Stuttgart have been on the uprise too, and, so there was plenty of competition. Leverkusen are just that good, even if they played shit for one half, plus they won the first fixture against West Ham 2-0 deservedly, so they could afford this due to that effort. They've also had a tight schedule, still haven't lost a SINGLE fixture this entire season in 3 competitions. One thing for sure, they would likely never be unbeaten all season in the prem, but would definitely sit way higher than West Ham in their current form...",

            "Wrong. It wasnt 'parking the bus'. He played 2 up front. Half of you don't know what you are talking about. I would have took generic Moyesball 4-2-3-1 over this botched version of 4-4-2 that we see today.",
            "Fulham were so compact in midfield but Iwobi and William know there jobs perfectly when it came time to break on West Ham they did and gave Fulham so much attacking width whereas West Ham seemed to have width all the time with players waiting on both wings for service so they were always going to get outdone in midfield.\nOne thing I noticed West Ham made very little noise they want Moyes gone.",
            "​ @damiandamico4715 🤦‍♂️ mate when you play 2 strikers upfront they play close together. Antonio and Ings couldn't have been much further apart. People need to learn that even though 2 strikers are starting the game it doesn't automatically mean the manager has decided to play 2 upfront.",
            " @darreno2428  The whole system was botched. If I were to score Moyes against the average of a PL manager yesterday, I struggle to give him more than a 1. He's got to the point where he is getting basic fundamentals wrong. If you are playing two strikers, play forward quickly. Have the wide men on the side of their strong foot. Make sure the two CMs can cover the ground in the middle of the park. Danny Ings is a striker, an absolutely terrible one, but a striker. Did he drop off into midfield at any one stage past either Alvarez or JWP to collect the ball as you would expect a 10 to? no. The whole system was trash. Moyes looks passive in comparison to every manager in the opposite dugout. I've had enough. The end.",
            " @damiandamico4715  he's the only manager I know of who'd sign Paqueta, Bowen and Kudus and play so negatively.",
            "😂😂 you started watching football this year mate",
            "Name one of our last 5 managers you’d like to come in replace him?\n\nPelegrini? Bilic? Allardyce? Avram Grant? Zola?\n\nHe is, almost without a doubt, the best manager West Ham have had in decades. Is it’s sometimes dull? Yes but it always has been! At least we’re not struggling to stay up",
            " @taracanyon1  “worst manager we ever had.” How is disagreeing with that showing a lack of ambition? Why would looking at our past with rose tinted glasses be ambitious?\n\nI don’t mind the idea of us moving on this summer. If we can line somebody exciting up then go for it but we need to recognise it’s a huge risk and also only a decision we make if we have somebody who really strong ready. \n\nIf he leave in the summer, we should be applauding Moyes as he goes. Best manager in my memory for sure. Maybe tied with Rednapp but I was only 8 then!\n\nHe goes who do we bring in? Potter? Young but unproven. Tuchel? Would he even say yes? Will Still? Inexperienced, never managed in England. Plenty of talent though",
            "Buy a history book mate.",
            " @MrEwragg  result wise he is the best, but also nobody spent that money much as him. Nobody had 500m to spent and also nobody played worst football than him.",
            " @HammerHealedCD  why? Is that suddenly going to make Moyes the worst manager we’ve ever had",
            " @Sp1NNN023  Allardyce? Zola? Grant? You think they played better football. The money is also a misnomer. Yes he has more money but so does everybody else. He’s not spending more than the average prem team\n\nI get the football style criticism. It’s dull. So dull. That does not make him West Ham’s worst manager of all time.",
            "​ @MrEwragg he's spent much more than the average manager/team. Infact since he came back he's spent more than Jurgen Klopp mate. It's fine sticking up for him if you like boring negative football and think no other manager could do better with players like Paqueta, Bowen, Kudus. Alverez ect, but don't make stuff up in an attempt to make him look good.",
            " @darreno2428  we’re 8th in average spend. Out of 20 teams that is just above average and matches our current league performance. \n\nLet’s be very clear, I have made one big point. David Moyes is not the worst manager West Ham have ever had. Ive said the football is dull. I’ve said I’d like a replacement for someone more ambitious but also that, results wise, he’s been a success. \n\nDo you think he is the worst manager West Ham have ever had? Honestly? It’s completely irrational",
            " @darreno2428  also, which managers. And I don’t mean that in a dismissive way but that getting rid of a proven manager with no solid back up is a recipe for relegation. Honestly, Potter is the only strong candidate for me. If he isn’t interested then who? All the managers I’d like are probably looking for bigger jobs",
            " @MrEwragg  no he's not the worst we've ever had, that's is ridiculous but his style is definitely one of the worst. There isn't many tbh. We've had lots of managers who failed but they weren't as boring to watch. This sums up Moyes perfectly - After the Europa game Antonio said \"we spoke before the game and said if we lose we only lose 1-0........\" that shit doesn't need saying but Moyes uses that in his team talk before the game.",
            " @MrEwragg  if want to compare them , compare them by league points per money they spent. Its stupid to compare them with Zola, Grant and Bilic. cause they we are all here for only 2 years which is not enough to build your squad. \n\nMoyes can only be compared to Big Sam,  and i enjoy way more Big Sam team and had more hope in games than with Deluded Dave. If Conference League was never invented the man would be long gone.  The bloke won first trophy with us , not with Everton not with United, but with us. The bloke should be more thankful to us than we are to him.",
            " @MrEwragg  The reason why he is the worst is cause spending 500m to just sit back and wait for opponent mistakes its not a tactic. Every fool can deploy team like that.",
            " @Sp1NNN023  stupid to compare? There’s a reason they only lasted 2 years!!! They were awful. Bilic admittedly had one great season but that was pure Payet not managerial class. Pellegrini spent huge money and again we were atrocious. \n\nYou can genuinely believe he is the worst manager we’ve ever had? If given the choice are you saying you’d swap him for Zola?\n\nYou cannot compare them by league points per money. The money is relative. Yes Moyes has spent more but so has every other prem team. We’re about average on our transfer spend (technically slightly over but that’s including the Rice money) \n\nIf you genuinely think he is the worst West Ham manager of all time then I can only assume you only just became a fan",
            " @MrEwragg  No mate.My point was aimed at the plum who claimed David Moyes was the worst manager we have ever had.You make some level headed points which is pretty rare in the toxic world of West Ham You Tube/Social Media",

Football has moved on from that brand of football. And for all what Moyes has done for The Hammers since his second spell, it’ll best for both parties to path ways this summer. West Ham need new coach with fresh ideas to move them forward and build some sustainability. Moyes staying any longer than this season will only dent his reputation at the club and create a toxic atmosphere for the players and the fans. That’s never a good thing.",

Moyes I get that you want to park the bus with a 3-1 lead, but use someone who can actually defend, ogbonna in a 5-2-3 would have solved it. Phillips can get gametime in a easier game, like the second leg vs freiburg. Dont use him and send him back, would rather see earthy make a debut tbh",

He didnt have to, gordon was off balance.   The problem also started from phillips teying to take the ball down in the box instead of clearing.   Just because gordon reacts fast is not cheating.",

If the defender was running with the ball and the Newcastle player put his foot in front of the running player and there was any contact, with the defender it would be called as tripping and a foul.    This isn't too much different.  I am swinging at the ball and another player manages in the last second to put his foot in front of mine without making contact with the ball it should be the same as in the first scenario a tripping foul for the defender.",

            "I feel sorry for him because he was great at Leeds so he's obviously got it in him.  Moyes's midfield has been  chaotic  all season so it's small wonder he doesn't know what his role is or how he should play the ball out.  Same goes for Ward Prowse who was great at Southampton and in the first few games of the season at West Ham but has gone steadily downhill since.",
            "A clear case of obstruction and clearly the should be offender came from behind. Never seen such blatant bias.",

            "Moyes must work on his defense 👷💼",
            "I dont know. I mean what do var say to each other to decide to award the 2nd penalty. Very quick players could get10 penalties every match just by putting themselves in an \"active\" space where a collision is inevitable. Most could see it but of course var....",
            "I fail to understand how the Phillips/Gordon clash results in a penalty decision--surely if Phillips had fallen over the foul would have been against Gordon, FFS.  Gordon comes at him from behind, puts his arms all over Phillips's back, then puts his leg in front of Phillips's trajectory.  How in any world is that judged a foul on Gordon?  VAR is mad.  The amount of times it comes up with a decision that is against the spirit of the game in every way is dismal.  \n\nHow Bielsa got a tune out of Phillips is a mystery, and Moyes is a long way from Bielsa so the decision to bring him on to \"give us more control in the middle of the pitch\" in Moyes's own words \" obviously didn't work \".  He's disrupted the cohesion of the midfield in  every game he's played in  for West Ham so why would it be any different in a game they're winning 3-1 then contrive to lose 4-3.  Pathetic Moyes.\n\nOffers will come in for Kudus, Paquetá, and probably Alvarez in the summer and suddenly West Ham will be looking back towards the bottom of the table.  They never, ever capitalize on talent when they manage to bring it in, so disappointing.  With a more enterprising manager this squad could have been pushing for fourth place this season.",

            "That was one of the worst performances I’ve ever seen",
            "Moysie is worst manager in West Ham history.  Before anyone says grant and Roeder worst they never had £500,000,000 to spend. I will celebrate the day Moyes leaves.  We should take bets on what league Moyes next coaches in. Saudi or Asian league would be my bet.",
            "If West Ham should continue this way, then I think it's going to be difficult for them  to keep Kudus in the team for the next 3 seasons. Big offers will surely distract him.",

You could simply throw your leg in someone's way before they kick a ball in the box and just like that penalty is called... And players are supposed to still jump up that high in a header banter without their hands for balance...very unsafe and silly.",

            "To be honest , it was the right decision . Seriously Phillip was to slow to clear the ball. We see this quite often on the pitch. Let say of this situation isn not in the penalty box.

I feel that there is a huge requirement for the 10 in that system to support Antonio's press, and we may upset the opposition's build-up more with Kudus taking that role rather than Paqueta. You also gain the link-up between Emerson and Paqueta down the left-hand side that we have seen so frequently this season. This is a consideration rather than an out-and-out suggestion.\n\n3) I agreed with the decision to make a defensive sub at the 65-minute mark, but my sub at the time would have been Phillips for Antonio, go 4-5-1, push Paqueta to the left, and rather than leave Bowen up top, I would have opted for Kudus to be the makeshift CF. \n\nAll in all, it's a relatively new system and there may be tweaks that incrementally improve us. I would have liked this 11 to start the season as soon as Kudus arrived.\n\nIt's been excellent so far. We look like we are overwhelming teams at times which is great to see. I still think there is a place for that 'low-block' system that Moyes has employed so frequently this season, but I would like it to be used in 20% of the games, rather than 80%. \n\nJust my takes from the game.\n\nWe are looking like a really, really good side again. If we can continue in the same vein and overwhelm certain teams and revert back to the system we used more frequently at the beginning of the season against certain sides, I think it gives us two ways of getting results.  \n\nCOYI",

Last week, a Burnley player literally headed the ball into his own hands and did a volleyball serve, and that isn't handball. But Kurt Zoumas was a handball having his arms down his sides? If Kurt played with no arms, it would have been the exact same result. A goal. \n\nThe rule is bullshit. Westham got scammed over and over the last 2 years, and if you don't recognise it, that's fine, but I do.\n\nThe Newcastle goal where it was a clear freekick for Paqueta. They gave it the other way, and they scored directly from it.  VAR didn't go back and say that freekick was for Westham and not for Newcastle. But it will go back and look at 6 different phases of play to try and find a reason to disallow every goal we score.",

Holds onto the ball too long, inaccurate passes, too slow, loses many 50/50 tackles, and can't defend 1 v 1. All this was apparent in his few cameos and starts at City, and I'm sure during all the weeks of mid-week squad scrimmages, so West Ham must really be short on players to have him start in midfield, yikes!",

Liverpool or Man City should take the title as they have the means.\nEveryone expects Arsenal to flop.... prove us wrong.

West Ham under Moyes only have 25-30% possession in most games. Yes Arsenal do pass the ball around more than us but so do every team. The reason for this is that Moyes tells the players to sit deep in their own half and let the other team have possession.

I used to peer out and watch us play truly brilliant and truly dreadful football alike from that balcony since before I was old enough to speak.

If Kudus was born in England, he would’ve been in a major academy and getting more attention than Saka and Bellingham.

            "john 3:17-21 ESV / 232 helpful votes Helpful Not Helpful\r\nFor God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.” Watching a football match is Great but think Jesus-Christ firstly then salvation will enter into your house.

I'm appalled when all he does is to dribble, destroying goalscoring opportunities instead of passing to team mates better positioned. There's a reason football is a team sport. As a fellow Ghanaian, I'll love Kudus to get to the heights of top attackers like Neymar / Mbappe even Messi (in his prime). Listen to seasoned soccer journalists on this matter and come to your own conclusions. Maybe you are like the proverbial ostrich.\n\nYou do not attack the arguments made by the OP (main focus is being selfish on the ball playing for Ghana).

To spot that is one thing but to actually execute it to perfection is something else entirely, very impressive! \nBut just in general overall, the contrast in performances from Sunday to last night is extraordinary it really is! \nWe were woeful against Everton but here against Arsenal, we were absolutely sensational literally EVERYTHING was better even the simple things like work rate, pressing and desire to win the ball back! \nThis was one of the best performances I've seen from us in a VERY long time, probably since Lyon away if I'm honest, now let's carry this momentum with us across London to Brentford on Saturday #COYI ⚒️⚒️⚒️",

If anything, both WP and Alvarez are replacing Rice, because WP can provide the long balls and driving forward and getting into the box as a late arriving midfielder or midfielder on the edge of the box, while Alvarez can protect the back 4. Rice could do both. He really is a phenomenal player...don't kid yourself. We either have to sacrifice Benrahma or Soucek to adjust to losing Rice... so it is no small sacrifice.",

            " @philwill0123  lol - you're making stuff up. Souček played deeper because initially Moyes wanted Paqueta to play further forward. That was the main failed experiment of early part of last season and mainly because Paqueta couldn't handle the physicality and he was getting brushed off the ball. Souček just had a bad season, nothing to do with tactics. And Rice has had a clear role for years, hasn't changed. Only difference was that Moyes encouraged him to drive forward more and get closer to the box, meaning Souček had to cover more for him when that happened. Souček was struggling more in the box because defenders had got wise to him arriving late and attacking the ball. \n\nNothing happens in a vacuum - opposition teams do research on our strengths and try to nullify them. Then you have to add more to the tactics but that also means adding more to the players' game, and that isn't always easy. It's one reason new players can inject new momentum to a team.",

            "Effective*** nothing about West Ham was attractive 😂 ...but hey 3 points is 3 points.",
            "Attractive??? Just negative football dude😂😂😂",
            " @muhammadfurqan7952  Negative? Hahahaha - it was the perfect counter-attacking team... soak up the pressure, wait for a mistake and pounce. There is nothing negative about that. It takes huge resilience, concentration and skill, especially in the transition... \n\nYou can only use what you have. There are teams like Brighton that are set up to hold possession and move the ball, but usually those teams struggle against the really good teams that are as good defensively as they are in attack. Many of the top teams combine both counter-attacking and possession football, because they have the type of top players who can do both. \n\nToo often, our players lose the ball in positions where top teams hold onto to it and can build a possession based attack. Usually, we are better at this as the season progresses, and I think as Paqueta, Alvarez, WP and Kudus become familiar with each other, we will have better play through the middle. \n\nThe problem I see for us over and over is the inability to deal with the high press... so we end up having to do defend rather than break out or even just thread the ball. The high press creates an overlap, so it's three against two, and in that situation, we have come unstuck so many times. It's like we don't see the press working, or we give the ball to a player who doesn't have space, hasn't created space, or cannot handle the close pressure. At least with Rice, we had some composure in those areas. It's no surprise to me that since Rice left, our possession ratio has gone down. We need Paqueta to be able to use his skills and positioning to be the pivot so that we can handle that high press better. \n\nIt isn't just about the manager saying 'I want us to play defensively'. No manager ever says that. But a manager will say 'if we cannot win the game, let's not lose it', and that is something that West Ham have done so much in my 40+ years of following them. Moyes is the first manager I've seen who actually knows how to properly organise a defence, with the possible exception of Rednapp.",

He must have been exhausted and wanted to avoid Moyes' teachings.\r\n\r\nWe need to stop blaming the players. \r\n\r\nBecause if Moyes leaves, there will naturally be no places for Soucek and Antonio.\r\n\r\nEven if you have a player with Premier League experience, it is meaningless if Moyes remains.\r\n\r\nNoble and Steidten and a new manager must rebuild the team.\r\n\r\nEven if it fails, we must give meaning to the challenge with a new vision and plan.\r\n\r\nLast year we placed 14th. Even with experienced managers and players.\r\n\r\nNew challenges coexist with success and failure. However, Moyes' challenge only exists to fail.\r\n\r\nMoyes is a historical figure and a legend. that won't change.\r\n\r\nwe have to take on a new challenge of winning the Europa League.\r\n\r\nI say it again.
